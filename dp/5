You are given an integer n. On each step, you may subtract one of the digits from the number.

How many steps are required to make the number equal to 0?

Input

The only input line has an integer n.

Output

Print one integer: the minimum number of steps.

Constraints

    1≤n≤10e6


Example

Input:
27

Output:
5

Explanation: An optimal solution is 27→20→18→10→9→0. 


- **PREREQUISITES**:
```
Minimal knowledge on what dp is.Please do refer to the conceptual section on dp if you are a beginner.

```

- **Solution**:


define:
dp[x] = minimum number of operations to go from x to zero.

When considering a number x, for each digit in the decimal representation of x, we can try to remove it. The transition is therefore: dp[x] = min<sub>d∈digits</sub>(x) dp[x-d].

We initialize dp[0] = 0.
we are good to go now.


- **TIME COMPLEXITY**:
```
O(n).
we can do this in a single loop.
```
