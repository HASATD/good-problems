You are given a rooted tree consisting of n nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n, and node 1 is the root. Each node has a color.

Your task is to determine for each node the number of distinct colors in the subtree of the node.

Input

The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n.

The next line consists of n integers c1,c2,…,cn: the color of each node.

Then there are n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output

Print n integers: for each node 1,2,…,n, the number of distinct colors.

Constraints
```
    1≤n≤2⋅10e5


1≤a,b≤n

1≤ci≤10e9
```

Example
```
Input:
5
2 3 2 2 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Output:
3 1 2 1 1

-**PREREQUISITES**:
```
Minimal knowledge on what trees are.Please do refer to the conceptual section on trees if you are a beginner.well this problem contains easy dp.

```

- **Solution**:

```

we are good to go now.
```

- **TIME COMPLEXITY**:
```
O(N) . we just visit all the nodes once. :)
