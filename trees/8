You are given a tree consisting of n nodes.

Your task is to determine for each node the sum of the distances from the node to all other nodes.

Input

The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output

Print n integers: for each node 1,2,…,n, the sum of the distances.

Constraints
```
1≤n≤2⋅105
1≤a,b≤n
```

-**PREREQUISITES**:
```
Minimal knowledge on what trees are.Please do refer to the conceptual section on trees if you are a beginner.well this problem contains easy dp.

```

- **Solution**:

```

we are good to go now.
```

- **TIME COMPLEXITY**:
```
O(N) . we just visit all the nodes once. :)
