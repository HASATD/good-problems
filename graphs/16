- **PREREQUISITES**:
```
Minimal knowledge on what graphs are.Please do refer to the conceptual section on graphs if you are a beginner.
You need to know search algorithms(traversal algorithms) to solve this problem.
=
```

- **Solution**:

```
the problem is can be solved with dp.Here there is no cycle so there could not be an infinite path.
What we can do if there is a path like A->B . we find maxpath
for a by just adding 1 to max path of b. dp[a]=max(dp[a],dp[b]+1)
we are good to go now.
```

- **TIME COMPLEXITY**:
```
O(n+m)
 where n is number of vertices and m is the number of edges.

```
