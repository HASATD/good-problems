- **PREREQUISITES**:
```
Minimal knowledge on what graphs are.Please do refer to the conceptual section on graphs if you are a beginner.
You need to know search algorithms(traversal algorithms) to solve this problem.
Please check the section on how to do topological sorting.
```

- **Solution**:

```
the problem is about simple topological sort.
we are good to go now.
```

- **TIME COMPLEXITY**:
```
O(n+m)
 where n is number of vertices and m is the number of edges.

```
