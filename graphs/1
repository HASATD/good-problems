You are given a map of a building, and your task is to count the number of its rooms. The size of the map is n×m squares, and each square is either floor or wall. You can walk left, right, up, and down through the floor squares.

Input

The first input line has two integers n and m: the height and width of the map.

Then there are n lines of m characters describing the map. Each character is either . (floor) or # (wall).

Output

Print one integer: the number of rooms.

Constraints

    1≤n,m≤1000


Example

- **PREREQUISITES**:
```
Minimal knowledge on what graphs are.Please do refer to the conceptual section on graphs if you are a beginner.
You need to know search algorithms(traversal algorithms) to solve this problem.
```

- **Solution**:

```
For each unvisited '.' cell we have to make dfs(or bfs)
and keep on coloring the visited nodes.We keep track number
of dfs by some count variable our answer would be count.

we are good to go now.
```

- **TIME COMPLEXITY**:
```
 O(n+m) time, where n is number of vertices and m is the number of edges.

```
