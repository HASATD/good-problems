- **PREREQUISITES**:
```
Minimal knowledge on what graphs are.Please do refer to the conceptual section on graphs if you are a beginner.
You need to know search algorithms(traversal algorithms) to solve this problem.
you need to know about bellman ford algorithm.
```

- **Solution**:

```
This problem can be solved using bellman ford algorithm .
the key idea is relax each edge n(number of node) times if there is no negative cycle
then because you should have got the final answer in n-1 iterations itself
which means if there is a negative cycle only then there will be some changes in nth iteration.
for more info check the graphconcepts section.

we are good to go now.
```

- **TIME COMPLEXITY**:
```
 You can do this by using bellman ford complexity o(n*m), where n is number of vertices and m is the number of edges.

```
