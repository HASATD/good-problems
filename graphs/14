- **PREREQUISITES**:
```
Minimal knowledge on what graphs are.Please do refer to the conceptual section on graphs if you are a beginner.
You need to know search algorithms(traversal algorithms) to solve this problem.
Please check the section on how to find a cycle.
```

- **Solution**:

```
The quesiton is about finding cycle in a directed graph. there are 3 types of vertex in dfs
color 1: white = the vertex is completely unvisited.
color 2: grey = the vertex whose some but not all child are visited.
color 3: black = the vertex whose all the child are visited .
Now there will be a cycle only when the vertex you are currently on has a grey child.

So how will trace the cycle .we can do it by storing the end grey vertex in a variable.
and add all the vertex when going back in the recursion until that grey vertex is again visited.
more about it

we are good to go now.
```

- **TIME COMPLEXITY**:
```
We can solve this problem by using Depth First Search in O(M) where M is number of edges.
 where n is number of vertices and m is the number of edges.

```
