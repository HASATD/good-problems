- **PREREQUISITES**:
```
Minimal knowledge on what graphs are.Please do refer to the conceptual section on graphs if you are a beginner.
You need to know search algorithms(traversal algorithms) to solve this problem.
you need to know about bellman ford algorithm.
```

- **Solution**:

```
Let say we are at node k we have to find weather there is a positive cycle ending
at k and if there if a cycle whether there is a path like 1->k->n then ans is zero.
You can do this by runnig dfs for each node and see if there is cycle ending at
that node with positive sum.if there is no such cycle you have to find biggest
route from 1 to n. 

we are good to go now.
```

- **TIME COMPLEXITY**:
```
 You can do this by using bellman ford complexity o(n*m), where n is number of vertices and m is the number of edges.

```
